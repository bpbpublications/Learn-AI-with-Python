# Learn AI with Python

This is the repository for [Learn AI with Python
](https://bpbonline.com/products/learn-ai-with-python?_pos=1&_sid=45e01d11a&_ss=r),published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book.
## About the Book
The book ‘Learn AI with Python’ is intended to provide you with a thorough understanding of artificial intelligence as well as the tools necessary to create your intelligent applications.
 
This book introduces you to artificial intelligence and walks you through the process of establishing an  AI environment on a variety of platforms. It dives into machine learning models and various predictive modeling techniques, including classification, regression, and clustering. Additionally,  it provides hands-on experience with logic programming, ASR, neural networks, and natural language processing through real-world examples and fully functional Python implementation. Finally, the book deals with profound models of learning such as R-CNN and YOLO. Object detection in images is also explained in detail using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are also explained.

By the end of this book, you will have a firm grasp of machine learning and deep learning techniques, as well as a steered methodology for formulating and solving related problems.
